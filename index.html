  The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web,
  is an <strong>information system</strong>
  where documents and other web resources are identified by
  Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/),
  which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over
  the Internet.</p>
  <img src="www.jpg" width=100%>
  <p>The resources of the WWW are transfered
  via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed
  by users by a software application called a web browser and are
  published by a software application called a web server.</p>
